# serialComunication
Simple C# program to send messages over serial on specified port.

Compile a terminal program, wiht this strings and characters can be sent through serial. Used originally to interface an arduino which would expect sepcific characters to move servos in specific ways, but can be used for almost anything as it simply is a snippet to interface with the C# serial library.
